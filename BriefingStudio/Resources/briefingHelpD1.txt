TXB BRIEFING HELP FOR DESCENT I
===============================

Sequence
--------

Sequence numbers are screen numbers, and are hardcoded.
For a complete table of screen numbers, consul
Appendix A.

Notes
-----
Note that text colors are hardcoded, but will be matched
against the palette of the current PCX background,
allowing some variation. In order to preserve the
correct colors, they should be present in the PCX palette.

Any lines starting with ; are ignored.

Commands
--------

Special commands start with a $ (dollar sign), and
should ideally on their own line (required if the line
contains another command).

$Sn
	Selects a new screen. The number should be that of
	a valid screen. For a list of valid screens and
	their numbers, consult Appendix A.

	Example:
		$S1
		; change to screen 1

$Cn
	Changes the text color. Available options are
		0: green
		1: beige
	If DXX extensions are enabled:
		2: red
		3: blue
		4: gray
		5: yellow
		6: purple
	Using DXX extensions in the original DOS game will
	result in undefined behavior.

	Example:
		$C0
		; All text from now on will be green.

$F
	Toggles the cursor, which is off by default.
	If the cursor is on, it is shown when every
	new character is drawn and will blink while
	waiting for a keypress.

$Tn
	Sets the tab stop value, in pixels.
	If a tab character is present in the briefing text,
	the cursor will be moved right until the tab stop
	point. THe default value is 0, effectively
	disabling tabs.

	Example:
	    $T70
		; Tab stop at 70 pixels. If the cursor is
		; now less than 70 pixels from the left edge
		; of the text area, a tab character will
		; move it there.

$P
	Ends a page. The next page will be displayed only
	when the player presses a key. If the cursor is
	enabled, the cursor will be shown flashing until
	the page is changed. Page changes will
	automatically disable all special animations.

$Rx
	Starts a robot animation. The animation
	consists of the robot model that slowly spins
	around, shown on the right side of the screen.
	The number selects the robot to be shown.
	For a list of numbers, consult Appendix B.
	The robot animation will be shown until a
	page change.

$Ntexture
	Displays a wall texture from the .PIG on the
	right side of the screen. The texture will be
	shown until a page change. The size of the
	bitmap will be assumed to be 64x64.

	Textures will be animated, but must have 14
	frames if so. Animations will thus play
	14 frames forward and then back. This is
	designed for the exit door (door13), which
	will be correctly shown opening and closing.

$Otexture
	Displays a wall texture from the .PIG on the
	right side of the screen. The texture will be
	shown until a page change. The size of the
	bitmap will be assumed to be 94x94.
	
	Textures will be animated, but must have 10
	frames if so. The animation will loop
	forever, playing the 10 frames forward
	indefinitely.

$Btexture
	Displays a BBM texture from the .HOG on
	the right side of the screen. The texture 
	will be shown until a page change. The
	filename should not include the .bbm
	extension, as it is added automatically.

	The BBM texture should be present in
	a .HOG file, and the optimal resolution
	is 64x64.
